### Creating a character

A character is defined by two files : a text file containing the description of your character and an optional thumbnail image, grouped into a single folder with the same name as your character.

Example :

```file
avatars/
└── characters/
    ├── character_1/
    │   ├── context.txt
    │   └── character.png
    ├── character_2/
    │   ├── context.txt
    │   └── character.png
    └── ...
```
